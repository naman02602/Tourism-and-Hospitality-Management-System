# Tourism and Hospitality Management System 

This project serves as one of the assignments completed for DAMG 6210 under Professor Nicholas Brown. The work has been done based on the learning recieved from regular lectures on data scraping, data munging/wrangling and data design in database.

## Background
As an industry, Tourism, and Hospitality are important for the country’s economic growth. However, from a tourist’s point of view, planning out travel has always been a hassle and a time taking process. Through this project, we would like to build a Database Management System that would suffice all the challenges that a tourist faces in planning a trip and finding accommodation. This project aims to develop a database consisting of tourist attractions, hotels, restaurants, tour guides, tour packages, etc 

## Data Gathering and Scraping 
We listed out the required data components to achieve the expected database. Then, looked to gather the data from multiple websites, and further used feasible options to scrape the data through BeatifulSoup, SelectorLib, etc.  

## Data Munging 
Data cleaning and preparation for SQL DB is done through python by reading the files in CSV format and transforming them based on the requirement. 

## Data Visualization
Data visualizations are conducted through python modules like matplotlib, seaborn and scipy. Additionally, various charts have been built on PowerBI specific to locations.
